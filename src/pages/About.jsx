        Hello I am Rahul Kumar. I am a B.Tech Student currently studying in
        G.L. Bajaj Institute of Technology, Greater Noida. I am constantly
        developing my skills and expanding my knowledge in various areas of
        technology.
        <br />
        <br />
        I want to develop things that have a tangible impact on peopleâ€™s lives.
        I believe more in practical than theory. So i try to code regularly and
        learn new things. I'm driven by the belief that technology has the power
        to transform the world for the better.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also love playing chess, reading books which improves my critical
        thinking. I believe in living life to the fullest and finding
        inspiration in every moment.
        <br />
        <br />
        This websites serves as my digital garden where I showcase my projects,
        share my insights, and connect with like-minded individuals who share my
        passion for technology and innovation.
